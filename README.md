## Graph problems

1. Connected components.
 - BFS/DFS numbering
2. Judge a Biparite Graph
 - BFS/DFS coloring
3. Judge cyclic graph
 - DFS with recStack
4. Euler tour
 - Euler tour judge: Connected grapth & all even degree.
 - Cycle finding algorithm: DFS
 - Fleury's algorithm: Find non-bridge edge.
5. Hamilton Cycle(NP-hard)
6. Graph isomorphism(Unknown)
7. Lay out a graph in plane without crossing edges
8. Diameter of graph
 - Two DFS/BFS
9. Center of a graph
 - Floyd algorithm, find minimum maxDis.
10. Topology sort
11. Strong Componets
 - Topology sort
 - Reverse Graph
12. Shortest directed cycle
 - G BFS/Dijkstra, G.reverse() BFS/Dijkstra
13. Hamilton path in DAG
 - Topology sort -> topological sequence. Hamilton path exists iff continuous vertexes in sequence are connected.
14. Reachable vertex in DAG
 - Only one zero-outdegree vertex.
15. Reachable vertex in Digragh
 - Topology sort
